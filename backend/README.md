# tidalwave — backend

tidalwave is a self-hosted, multi-user listening tracker for Tidal. Because Tidal does not expose a listening-history API, users scrobble their Tidal plays to Last.fm (via the Tidal app or a scrobbler) and tidalwave pulls that history through the Last.fm `user.getRecentTracks` API. The backend is a FastAPI service backed by PostgreSQL; it handles Last.fm OAuth-style authentication, per-user scrobble ingestion, stats aggregation, and shareable read-only links.

## Local development

**Prerequisites:** [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a running PostgreSQL instance.

The easiest way to get Postgres is via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d        # starts postgres:16 on localhost:5432
```

Then install dependencies, run migrations, and start the dev server:

```bash
uv sync
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn tidalwave.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

The API is now available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Environment variables

All settings are read from environment variables prefixed with `TIDALWAVE_` (or from a `.env` file in the working directory).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TIDALWAVE_DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql+asyncpg://tidalwave:tidalwave@localhost:5432/tidalwave` | Async SQLAlchemy connection URL for PostgreSQL. |
| `TIDALWAVE_LASTFM_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | Last.fm API key. Obtain one at https://www.last.fm/api/account/create. |
| `TIDALWAVE_LASTFM_API_SECRET` | *(empty)* | Last.fm API secret corresponding to the key above. |
| `TIDALWAVE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Public base URL of this service. Used to build the `cb=` callback parameter sent to Last.fm during auth. Must be reachable by the browser completing the OAuth flow. |
| `TIDALWAVE_REGISTRATION_MODE` | `allowlist` | Controls who may connect a Last.fm account. `open` allows anyone; `allowlist` restricts to the usernames listed in `TIDALWAVE_REGISTRATION_ALLOWLIST`. |
| `TIDALWAVE_REGISTRATION_ALLOWLIST` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated list of Last.fm usernames permitted to register when `REGISTRATION_MODE=allowlist`. Example: `alice,bob`. |
| `TIDALWAVE_SESSION_SECRET` | `dev-insecure-change-me` | Secret used to sign the session cookie with itsdangerous. **Must be set to a strong random value in production.** |
| `TIDALWAVE_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Python logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`). |

---

## Last.fm connect flow

1. Register a Last.fm API account at https://www.last.fm/api/account/create to obtain an API key and secret. Set `TIDALWAVE_LASTFM_API_KEY` and `TIDALWAVE_LASTFM_API_SECRET`.
2. A user visits `GET /auth/login`. The server redirects the browser to Last.fm's authorization page.
3. Last.fm redirects back to `GET /auth/callback?token=<token>`. The server exchanges the one-time token for a permanent session key, then creates or logs in the user via `upsert_user_from_session`.
4. The first user to connect automatically becomes admin. Subsequent registrations are gated by `TIDALWAVE_REGISTRATION_MODE`; a 403 is returned if the Last.fm username is not on the allowlist when mode is `allowlist`.
5. On success the server sets an `httponly` session cookie and redirects to `/`.
6. `POST /auth/logout` clears the cookie.

## Endpoints

### Health

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | None | Returns `{"status": "ok"}`. |

### Auth

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/auth/login` | None | Redirects to Last.fm authorization page. |
| `GET` | `/auth/callback` | None | Receives Last.fm token, creates/logs in user, sets session cookie. |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | None | Clears session cookie. |

### Stats (session-gated — requires valid session cookie)

| Method | Path | Query params | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/stats/top-artists` | `limit` (default 20), `since`, `until` | Top artists by listen count for the authenticated user. |
| `GET` | `/stats/top-tracks` | `limit` (default 20), `since`, `until` | Top tracks by listen count. |
| `GET` | `/stats/top-albums` | `limit` (default 20), `since`, `until` | Top albums by listen count. |
| `GET` | `/stats/clock` | `since`, `until` | 24-element array of listen counts by hour of day (UTC). |
| `GET` | `/stats/weekday` | `since`, `until` | 7-element array of listen counts by ISO weekday (index 0 = Monday). |
| `GET` | `/stats/history` | `bucket` (`day`\|`week`\|`month`, default `day`), `since`, `until` | Chronological time-series: `[{"period": <iso>, "count": N}]`. |
| `GET` | `/stats/recent` | `limit` (default 50) | Most recent listens. |
| `GET` | `/stats/summary` | `since`, `until` | `{"total_listens": N}`. |

`since` / `until` are optional ISO-8601 datetimes (`until` is exclusive).

### Shares (session-gated)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/shares` | Creates a new share token for the authenticated user. Returns `{"share_token": "..."}`. |
| `DELETE` | `/shares/{token}` | Revokes a share token owned by the authenticated user. |

### Public shared views (no auth required)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/shared/{token}/top-artists` | Top artists for the share's owner (read-only, no login required). |
| `GET` | `/shared/{token}/summary` | Total listens for the share's owner. |

## Running the poller and backfill

These are console scripts installed by `uv sync` (see `[project.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml`).

**One-pass poll** — fetches new scrobbles for every connected user since their last sync:

```bash
tidalwave-poll
```

This is intended to be run on a schedule, e.g. every 5 minutes via cron or a Kubernetes CronJob.
Per-user failures are isolated (one bad account never aborts the run). If a user's Last.fm
session key is invalid/revoked (auth error), that user is flagged `disconnected` and skipped on
subsequent polls until they reconnect via `/auth/login`; transient errors (rate limits, outages)
are logged and retried on the next run.

Reads are authenticated with each user's stored Last.fm session key, so private "hide recent
listening" profiles are readable; public profiles work either way.

**Full-history backfill** — imports a user's entire Last.fm history (may take a while for accounts with many scrobbles):

```bash
tidalwave-backfill <lastfm-username>
```

Both commands read configuration from the same `TIDALWAVE_*` environment variables as the server.

## Tests

Tests require a running PostgreSQL instance. By default the test suite connects to the same URL as the application default (`postgresql+asyncpg://tidalwave:tidalwave@localhost:5432/tidalwave`). Override with:

```bash
export TIDALWAVE_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...
```

Run the suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```
